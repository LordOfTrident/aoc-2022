# [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/12)
In Ruby

<hr>

A simple language that reminds me of Python and Lua - and i like that. Day 12 was pain tho because
of silent bugs that i spent hours looking for, so be aware that i am not responsible for any medical
issues caused upon seeing the source code

> TODO: Clean up the source code

## Quickstart
```sh
$ ruby part1.rb
$ ruby part2.rb
```
