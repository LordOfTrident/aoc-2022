# [Day 07](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7)
In Python

<hr>

Ive been avoiding this language for a long time, but i think the time has come to finally try it.
This is my first time using python, and the languages used for the days after this one are probably
all gonna be new to me aswell.

## Quickstart
```sh
$ python3 part1.py
$ python3 part2.py
```
